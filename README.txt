Pidgin has been packed here instead of the actual AOL, because it didn't work on Windows 10, as it just froze my desktop for a while, so it may be possible that it'll happen to you.
How to setup pidgin for AOL :

Install Pidgin from "pidgin-2.14.8.exe". If it is an old version according to the official Pidgin website, download the latest version from https://pidgin.im/. Make sure to download the Windows version.

Run the Pidgin application by selecting it from the Windows Start Menu

In the Buddy List window, click on the Accounts menu and select "Manage Accounts".

You will be welcomed to Pidgin and on that dialog, click the Add button.

Enter the appropriate information into the Basic tab of the Add Account dialog

Use the same username and password you use to login to AOL Phoenix (phoenixim.ddns.net)

Check the "Remember password" button so that you don't have to log on every time you run Pidgin.

Basic settings dialog used when adding a new account to Pidgin

Click the Advanced tab in the Add Account dialog

Now here's something important you need to know : ALWAYS DISABLE ClientLogin (use MD5 based) and TURN OFF ENCRYPTION on connection security.

Now in the server field, replace the default text with "phoenixim.ddns.net" (excluding the quotation marks)

Click Save and you will be asked to verify the SSL Certificate

Click Accept and close all Pidgin windows. Now launch Pidgin and if it works, congrats, you have AOL! If not, use a VM to setup the original AOL.
